# domain-block-list

This is a list of my blocklist.  This list mainly consist of places that I do not frequent nor do I want them tracking me.

I will go through my blocklist line by line to explain my reasoning for it.

## Facebook/Meta

I do not utilize Facebook or any social media that is associated with Facebook, such as Instagram.  Therefore I block all of Facebook/Meta's domains to prevent tracking cross-site.

## Twitter/X

I also block X/Twitter since I don't utilize their service.  They have been known to popup around on the internet.  I just don't want them tracking me.

## .run TLD

I just don't want any confusion when it comes to executing commands.  So I just block the .run

Some other TLDs I was considering blocking

- .zip
- .mov

## URL Shortners 

In general, I do not like the anonymous URL shortners.  I prefer the ones that you can tell where they come from, for example youtu.be is YouTube's URL shortner.  Therefore I block:
- bit.ly
- buff.ly

## Google Login Popup 

I love you Google, but just to read a news article, I don't need to sign-in to my Google Account to read an article.  Therefore I did a block on the sign-in page.

## Honey and Other Marketing Affiliate Robbers 🍯

I do appreciate a good YouTube video, and I will click marketing affiliate links when there is a product I am interested in and I found the video to be helpful.  I have done this mainly on my technology purchases, such as Travel Routers, pfSense, etc.

When it came to my attention that Honey and others were stealing the last click attribution from the creators, that well 🤬 me off.

So they now all get a ban in my list.  This is a non-comprehensive list and when it comes to my attention that there is more, I will add them.

## Link Rewriters

There are some link rewriters that I do not wish to work with, therefore, I have blocked them.

## More additions ➕

As more details come up, I will add or remove from my list.  Please feel free to use in its entirety, or partially.  Free License.
